      <p>
        Mira hadn’t spoken a word in over a year. Not since the accident—the one that stole her voice and her parents.
        The city buzzed outside her apartment window, but inside her world was still. She communicated through scribbles
        in a worn-out notebook, pages filled with thoughts she could never say aloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        At school, most avoided her. They didn’t know how to interact with someone who didn’t speak. But then came Jayden—
        the transfer student who sat beside her in art class. Unlike the others, he didn’t treat her like glass. He simply
        passed her notes with doodles, funny thoughts, and little poems.
      </p>
      <p>
        One afternoon, they found themselves alone in the art room. Rain tapped the window. Mira drew a single step—a foot
        hovering in motion, with music notes swirling around it. Jayden looked at it, then at her. “Is this how it feels?”
        he whispered. She nodded.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that day, Jayden began walking beside her during lunch, dancing playfully in the hallway just to make her smile.
        Mira started filming him. Not with words, but with videos—her silent storytelling. She began uploading short clips
        to an anonymous account called “Silent Step.” Each one was a moment from their journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        The world noticed. Her videos spoke louder than any words. And slowly, Mira realized her silence was not a weakness.
        It was a new voice—one that resonated through movement, connection, and emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        One evening, as Jayden walked her home, he stopped. “You know,” he said, “even if you never speak again, I hear
        you clearer than anyone.” Mira took his hand, smiled, and for the first time in over a year, stepped forward—
        not with her feet, but with her heart.

      <div class="story-title">The Brave Little Turtle</div>
      <p>
        In a lush forest near the Great Waterfall, lived Tiko, a young turtle with a tiny shell and a big heart. While
        other turtles stayed hidden and cautious, Tiko dreamed of exploring the far lands beyond the riverbank.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, the forest grew silent. Birds flew in circles. A fire had started near the mountain, and the wind was
        pushing smoke toward their peaceful home. The animals panicked, scattering in fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Tiko did not run. He saw that baby mice were trapped near a burning log. With determination, he slid over
        rocks and mud, risking his shell to guide them out. It wasn’t easy. Ash covered his back, and tears stung his
        eyes, but he pushed forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Tiko returned with the last mouse on his back, the animals cheered. The birds flapped above him. Even the
        owls hooted his name. That night, as stars lit the sky, Tiko sat near the waterfall, feeling something new
        inside—courage.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that day on, whenever danger came, the animals knew they had someone brave. Not the biggest or fastest—but
        the boldest.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so, the tale of the Brave Little Turtle was told again and again, as the forest slept under the moonlight.
