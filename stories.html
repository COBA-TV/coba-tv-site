      <p>Mira once lived a quiet but happy life with her loving parents in the heart of a small town. Everything changed on a rainy evening when their car skidded off the road in a tragic accident. Mira survived, but her parents didn’t. The trauma left her not just emotionally shattered — she lost her voice entirely.</p>
      <p>Now mute, Mira struggled in a world full of noise. People pitied her, some avoided her. But inside her, a storm brewed. She learned to communicate through drawing, and slowly, her emotions turned into powerful silent art. Her sketches spoke louder than words.</p>
      <p>One day, her school organized a local art contest. Mira hesitated but eventually entered it with a drawing that depicted her story — a broken girl walking through a storm with no mouth, but a heart glowing like a lantern. The drawing shook everyone.</p>
      <p>She didn’t just win — she inspired others. Her silence became her strength. She started workshops for children with trauma and taught them how to express through art. Mira never regained her voice, but she no longer needed it. Her steps may have been silent, but they echoed far and wide.</p>

      <p>In the deep blue waters of the Coral Kingdom lived a tiny turtle named Timo. He wasn’t the fastest swimmer or the biggest reptile, but he had something no one else did — courage.</p>
      <p>One day, a strange shadow appeared above the reef. The elder dolphins warned everyone: a fishing boat had dropped its net near their home. Sea creatures panicked. But Timo didn’t. He swam upward, weaving through seaweed and danger, and with his tiny flippers, he gnawed at the net’s rope.</p>
      <p>Bit by bit, the rope snapped, and the net drifted away. The sea creatures were safe, and the coral reef undisturbed. Timo returned home a hero. From that day, the littlest turtle was known as the bravest in the sea.</p>
